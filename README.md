Our Docker image is modeled after a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The image enables us to cache our software dependencies and test as much logic as possible without loading to a physical device.

### Getting Started

```bash
docker build -t lantern-core .
docker run -it lantern-core 
```

### Disclaimer
This repository is under active development and not yet intended for widespread use.
